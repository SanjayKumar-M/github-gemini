## Github Evaludator


1. The code didn't followed Page Object Model.

2. The WebDriver session opened by FirefoxDriver is not closed properly at the end of the test case. This could lead to resource leaks:
WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();

3.  There is a nested class PagesforAutomationAssignment defined inside the Testcase101 class, which is not syntactically correct and will result in a compilation error:
      public class PagesforAutomationAssignment {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Code
    }
}
This class should be defined outside the Testcase101 class.

4.  Thread.sleep(milliSeonds) on lines 50, 56, 70, and 82 is a static wait that should not be used. Alternatively, depending on the wait circumstances, we can employ dynamic waits (implicit, explicit, fluorescent, etc.).

Yeah it is scraping the content from PR correctly and evaluating, but when i submit a project url like this  https://github.com/SanjayKumar-M/QA-testing  where neither readme file nor comments on the code file is present ,it is giving me a feedback like this

## Candidate Evaluation:

**Summary of Bugs Found:**

* **Hardcoded Driver Path (1):**  The candidate uses a fixed path for the "geckodriver.exe" file, which limits code portability and reusability.
* **Implicit Waits (2):** The candidate relies heavily on `Thread.sleep()` for synchronization, which is not robust and makes the test fragile.
* **No Page Object Model (3):** The candidate does not implement a Page Object Model (POM) and uses element locators directly within the test code, leading to poor code organization and maintainability.
* **Missing Imports (4):** There are missing imports for `ChromeDriver` and `List` in the `PagesforAutomationAssignment` class.
* **Chrome-only Driver (5):** The candidate only initializes the driver for Chrome, limiting the test to a single browser.
* **Incorrect Use of Static Members (6):** There are errors in using static members inside non-static classes. For example, `driver` is defined as static in `BasePage`, but it should be instance-level. 
* **Inappropriate Use of Exceptions (7):** The candidate uses exceptions for validation purposes in the `verifyHomePage()` method, which is not an ideal practice.

**Assessment of Severity and Importance of Findings:**

* **Hardcoded Driver Path:** **High severity**. This makes the code non-portable and difficult to run on different machines.
* **Implicit Waits:** **High severity**. The use of `Thread.sleep()` makes the test unreliable and slower.
* **No Page Object Model:** **High severity**. Lack of POM makes the code difficult to maintain and extend.
* **Missing Imports:** **Medium severity**. The missing imports cause compilation errors.
* **Chrome-only Driver:** **Medium severity**. It limits testing to one browser.
* **Incorrect Use of Static Members:** **High severity**. Incorrect usage of static members can lead to unexpected behavior and data sharing issues.
* **Inappropriate Use of Exceptions:** **Medium severity**. Using exceptions for validation can make the code less readable and harder to troubleshoot.

**Missed or Misunderstood Bugs:**

* **Element Locators:**  The candidate uses absolute XPaths in many places. While they work, relative XPaths are more robust and maintainable.
* **Redundant Actions:** The candidate uses `Actions` for moving to an element repeatedly, which is unnecessary as the `click()` method already performs this action.
* **Limited Cross-Browser Testing:** The candidate only focuses on Firefox, neglecting other major browsers, which is crucial for ensuring website compatibility.
* **Dynamic Waits:**  The candidate could have implemented explicit waits using `WebDriverWait` for elements to be visible, clickable, etc., improving the test's reliability and reducing unnecessary delays.

**Verdict:**

The candidate shows potential but needs further development in key areas. They have identified several bugs and have a basic understanding of test automation concepts. 

**Strengths:**

* **Basic Understanding of Selenium:** They demonstrate basic knowledge of Selenium WebDriver, using methods like `findElement`, `sendKeys`, and `click()`.
* **Basic Page Object Model:** The candidate has attempted to implement a Page Object Model with classes for `LoginPage`, `HomePage`, and `BasePage`. This indicates a willingness to learn and apply good practices.
* **Effort in Identifying Bugs:** They have put in effort to find some bugs within the code, demonstrating their attention to detail.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Robustness and Reliability:** The candidate needs to understand best practices for creating robust and reliable tests. This includes using dynamic waits, avoiding `Thread.sleep()`, and using relative locators for elements.
* **Page Object Model:** The candidate needs to solidify their understanding of the Page Object Model and further improve its implementation.
* **Cross-Browser Testing:** The candidate needs to learn and apply best practices for cross-browser testing.
* **Understanding of Static Members:** The candidate needs to understand the difference between static and instance-level members and their correct usage.

**Recommendation:**

While the candidate has a good starting point, they need further guidance and practice before being ready for an internship. I recommend providing feedback on the areas for improvement and offering them opportunities to learn and practice these concepts. They have the potential to be a valuable contributor, but they need to focus on solidifying their understanding of core test automation principles.  

Make sure that this is accurate and authentic if no readme or comments in code present, state that the candidate does not found any bugs lieke message. Got it?
