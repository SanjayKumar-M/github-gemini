        "See we are hiring SDETs for both junior and senior role. We use to give them assignments in java, separately for juniors and seniors in a GitHub repo. Now the candidates can find the bug or can give feedback. There are 3 possible ways, either they can create their own repo, and add the bugs or feedback report directly as comments in the code file itself under the code lines, the another way is creating readme file and writing the feedback bug report over there, or the can directly raise a PR for that repo we shared, where they mention the bug feedback as PR comments.  I need you to analyse in all possible ways and analyse their feedback bug report and give us a quality accurate feedback on the candidate's skills, the bug they found, their severity , what bugs they missed. and final verdict like whether we can proceed with that candidate or not\n",

        "You're smart to use coding assignments to assess SDET candidates! Let's dive into how we can make those assignments even more effective and build a robust evaluation process:\n\n**1. Assignment Design is Key**\n\n* **Targeted Skills:** Ensure your assignments accurately reflect the skills you need in Junior and Senior SDETs:\n    * **Juniors:** Focus on code understanding, basic testing techniques (e.g., boundary analysis), and finding straightforward bugs (logic errors, input validation).\n    * **Seniors:** Include aspects of test design, automation potential, performance considerations, and identifying edge cases that juniors might miss.\n* **Clear Instructions:** Provide unambiguous requirements and expectations for the task. Specify how candidates should interact with the codebase (forking, cloning, etc.). This ensures fairness and helps you evaluate candidates based on their technical ability rather than their ability to decipher instructions. \n\n**2. Feedback Mechanisms (Analyzing the How)**\n\nYou've highlighted three ways candidates can provide feedback – let's evaluate each:\n\n* **Candidate's Own Repo + Report:** \n    * **Pros:**  Provides candidates flexibility, shows initiative in using version control (a good sign!), and lets them showcase documentation skills.\n    * **Cons:**  Adds complexity in reviewing multiple repositories and might require more time for evaluation. \n* **Code Comments:** \n    * **Pros:**  Direct, easy for reviewers to map feedback to specific lines of code. \n    * **Cons:** Might clutter the codebase, not suitable for high-level or design feedback.\n* **Pull Request (PR) with Comments:**\n    * **Pros:**  Industry-standard workflow, excellent for assessing git proficiency, encourages well-structured feedback, facilitates potential discussion if you choose to engage. \n    * **Cons:**  Requires some Git knowledge from candidates (expected at a senior level but may pose a barrier for juniors).\n\n**Recommendation:** I suggest encouraging the **Pull Request (PR)** approach for both juniors and seniors. It reflects modern development practices and provides the most structured way to assess both technical and communication skills. Offer clear instructions and even a basic Git cheat sheet for juniors to level the playing field.\n\n**3. Evaluation Rubric: Beyond the Bug (Analyzing the What)**\n\nHere's how to structure your evaluation, going beyond simply \"did they find the bug?\":\n\n* **Code Analysis & Testing:**\n    * **Bug Identification:** Types of bugs found (functional, logical, edge cases), their severity (critical, major, minor), and if any expected bugs were missed.\n    * **Test Approach:**  Evidence of structured testing methods, exploration of edge cases, boundary value analysis.  Look for candidates who demonstrate a strategic approach rather than random clicking.\n    * **Code Quality:** (If applicable) Assess the candidate's own code if they fixed the bug or added test cases - readability, adherence to style guidelines, efficiency.\n\n* **Technical Skills:**\n    * **Tooling:**  Proficiency with Git (based on the PR workflow), debugging tools, or any testing frameworks you expect them to know. \n    * **Problem Solving:** How well they articulate their thought process, justify their findings, and propose potential solutions.\n\n* **Communication:**\n    * **Clarity:** Is the feedback concise, well-organized, and easy to understand?  \n    * **Professionalism:** Tone, grammar, and overall presentation of their findings.\n\n**4. Final Verdict**\n\n* **Proceed?**  \n    *  **Strong Yes:**  Found critical/major bugs, demonstrated solid technical skills, clear communication, and a structured approach. \n    * **Yes (Potential):**  Found some bugs, showed good understanding, might need guidance in some areas, or missed some key aspects. Further interviews or follow-up tasks are useful. \n    *  **No:**  Missed significant bugs, displayed poor testing practices, lack of understanding, weak communication.\n* **Feedback:** Always provide constructive feedback to ALL candidates – it improves your process and candidate experience.  For those who did well, it reinforces their good work and sets expectations for the next stage.\n\n**Important Notes:** \n* **Tailor:** Adapt this rubric based on seniority level – expectations for seniors should be considerably higher.\n* **Standardize:** Use consistent evaluation criteria across candidates to avoid bias. \n\nBy incorporating these strategies, you'll not only assess candidates effectively but also showcase your company's robust engineering culture from the very beginning. \n\nLet me know if you'd like help developing specific rubrics, sample assignments, or brainstorming ideas for evaluating particular skills within these assessments. I'm here to assist! \n",

This is the assignment file we are planning to give to junior sdet role.   1. Code Organization and Structure:\n   - The code lacks proper organization and separation of concerns. All the code is written in a single class (`Testcase101`), making it difficult to understand and maintain.\n   - The `main` method is very long and contains multiple test steps, which violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). It should be broken down into smaller, focused methods or separate test cases.\n   - The code for different page interactions (login, status creation, priority creation, deletion) should be separated into different methods or classes for better readability and reusability.\n   - The `PagesforAutomationAssignment` class and its inner classes (`BasePage`, `LoginPage`, `HomePage`, `TablePage`) seem to be incomplete or not properly integrated with the main test case.\n2. Locators and Element Identification:\n   - The code heavily relies on XPath selectors, which are brittle and can easily break if the page structure changes. It's recommended to use more stable and maintainable locators like IDs, classes, or CSS selectors when possible.\n   - Some locators are duplicated across the code, violating the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Consider storing locators in a separate class or using the Page Object Model for better maintenance.\n   - The code uses `findElement(By.tagName())` in several places, which is not a reliable approach as it may return multiple elements. Use more specific locators to identify the desired element uniquely.\n3. Waits and Synchronization:\n   - The code uses `Thread.sleep()` for waiting, which is a poor practice. It introduces unnecessary delays and doesn't guarantee that the elements are actually ready for interaction. Replace `Thread.sleep()` with explicit waits or fluent waits provided by Selenium.\n   - The code uses `implicitlyWait` inconsistently. It's set to 30 seconds initially but later changed to 20 seconds. Stick to a consistent implicit wait time throughout the test.\n4. Error Handling and Logging:\n   - The code lacks proper error handling and logging mechanisms. If an exception occurs during test execution, it will simply terminate without providing meaningful error messages or logging the failure details.\n   - Implement try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully and log the error messages for debugging purposes.\n   - Consider using a logging framework (e.g., Log4j, SLF4J) to log important steps, actions, and errors during the test execution.\n5. Code Duplication and Reusability:\n   - There are instances of code duplication, such as finding the \"Tickets\" element and performing mouse hover actions. Extract common functionalities into separate methods to promote code reuse and maintainability.\n   - The `PagesforAutomationAssignment` class and its inner classes seem to be an attempt to create page objects, but they are not utilized in the main test case. Implement the Page Object Model properly to encapsulate page-specific functionalities and improve code reusability.\n6. Hardcoded Values and Configuration:\n   - The code contains hardcoded values, such as usernames, passwords, and URLs. Consider externalizing these values into configuration files or properties to make the code more flexible and easier to modify.\n   - The WebDriver path is hardcoded, which limits the portability of the code. Use relative paths or allow configuring the WebDriver path through system properties or configuration files.\n7. Code Comments and Documentation:\n   - The code lacks proper comments and documentation, making it difficult for other developers to understand the purpose and flow of the test case. Add meaningful comments to explain complex logic, test steps, and expected behaviors.\n   - Provide a high-level description or documentation explaining the overall test scenario, prerequisites, and expected outcomes.\n8. Test Data Management:\n   - The code uses hardcoded test data (e.g., status name, priority name) directly in the test case. Consider separating test data from the test code and storing it in external files (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV) or a test data management tool for better maintainability and data-driven testing.\n9. Naming Conventions:\n   - Some variable and method names are not descriptive enough (e.g., `r`, `moveTo`, `make`). Use meaningful and self-explanatory names that convey the purpose of the variable or method.\n   - Follow Java naming conventions consistently, such as using camelCase for variable and method names, and PascalCase for class names.\n10. Code Formatting and Style:\n    - The code formatting is inconsistent in some places, with irregular indentation and spacing. Maintain consistent code formatting throughout the codebase to improve readability.\n    - Follow Java code style guidelines, such as using braces for single-line statements and keeping a consistent line length.\n11. Accessibility and Responsiveness:\n    - The code doesn't consider accessibility aspects, such as testing for keyboard navigation or screen reader compatibility. Include accessibility testing scenarios to ensure the application is usable by all users.\n    - The code doesn't handle responsiveness or different screen sizes. Consider adding tests to verify the application's behavior and layout on different devices and screen resolutions.\n12. Security and Data Privacy:\n    - The code directly handles sensitive information like usernames and passwords. Ensure that sensitive data is not hardcoded and is securely stored and accessed.\n    - Consider implementing security best practices, such as using encrypted passwords, secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS), and protecting against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).\n13. Performance and Scalability:\n    - The code doesn't include any performance testing or measurement. Consider adding performance metrics and assertions to ensure the application meets the desired performance criteria.\n    - The test case focuses on a single user flow and doesn't cover concurrent user scenarios. Include tests to verify the application's behavior under load and concurrent access.\n14. Browser and Environment Compatibility:\n    - The code uses FirefoxDriver for testing, but it doesn't specify the compatible browser versions or handle different browser configurations. Ensure that the tests are compatible with the supported browser versions and consider testing on multiple browsers.\n    - The code assumes a specific operating system (Windows) and hardcodes the WebDriver path accordingly. Make the code more platform-independent by using relative paths or allowing configuration for different environments.\n15. Test Coverage and Scenarios:\n    - The code covers a specific user flow but lacks comprehensive test coverage. Identify and include additional test scenarios to cover different functionalities, edge cases, and negative scenarios.\n    - Consider applying boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning techniques to generate effective test cases and improve test coverage.\n16. Reporting and Integration:\n    - The code doesn't generate any test reports or integrate with any reporting frameworks. Implement test reporting mechanisms to provide clear and concise reports on test execution results, including passed/failed tests, error messages, and screenshots.\n    - Consider integrating the test code with a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate test execution and ensure the application's quality in different environments.\nIn summary, the code has significant room for improvement in terms of code organization, maintainability, error handling, synchronization, and adherence to best practices. By addressing the mentioned points and following software testing principles and guidelines, the code can be enhanced to create a more robust, reliable, and efficient test suite.

        "Excellent! Thanks for providing the assignment and expected feedback. This is incredibly helpful in evaluating Junior SDET candidates.\n\n**Here's how I'll approach the evaluation, blending your feedback with the candidate's findings:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Junior Context:** I'll keep in mind that this is a Junior SDET role. While we want to see good instincts and potential, we can't expect flawless code or advanced automation skills.  \n\n2. **Candidate's Perspective is Key:** Your \"expected feedback\" is a fantastic guide for identifying potential areas of improvement in the candidate's submission. However, their own unique bug discoveries and how they articulate them are just as important.  Even if they don't catch everything you did, the quality of their thought process and the types of bugs they find will reveal a lot about their potential.\n\n3. **Structured Assessment:** For any Junior SDET candidate's submission, I will use the following framework, informed by both your detailed insights and the candidate's actual work: \n\n    * **Basic Functionality:** Did they manage to run the code at all? This is essential for any Junior role—it shows they can set up a development environment and interact with existing code. \n    * **Bug Finding:** \n       * **Types:** What kinds of bugs did they find? Were they purely visual, functional, logic-based?  \n       * **Severity:** Did they catch critical errors that would significantly impact users or more minor, cosmetic issues?  *Juniors might miss edge cases—that's where your \"expected feedback\" comes in!*\n       * **Reproducibility:** Did they clearly describe the steps to reproduce the bug, including any specific data or conditions needed? \n       * **Clarity:**  Is the bug report well-structured and easy to understand, even if the technical writing isn't perfect?  \n    * **Testing Approach:**\n        * **Evidence of a plan:**  Did they approach this in a systematic way? This might be as simple as stating they checked different inputs, went through various workflows, etc. *Juniors are still learning!*\n        * **Going beyond the obvious:**  Even if they didn't follow all the testing principles your \"expected feedback\" lists, did they try *anything* beyond simply running the code and looking for errors?\n    * **Technical Skills:**  \n        * **Basic Selenium Understanding:** Did they demonstrate any grasp of how Selenium commands work (finding elements, interacting with them, basic assertions)?\n        * **Git/GitHub Proficiency (If applicable):**  If you requested the PR method, were they able to follow basic instructions, even if they weren't Git experts?\n    * **Communication and Potential:** \n       * **Enthusiasm:** Does the feedback, even with errors, show some interest in learning and improving their testing skills? \n       * **Potential to learn:** Based on the way they approached the problem, would you be able to mentor and train them on the aspects highlighted in your \"expected feedback\"?\n\n4. **The Verdict (Strong Yes, Yes (Potential), No) and Next Steps:**\n    * This will be a **combination** of how many actual bugs they found, the quality of their reporting, and their demonstrable potential based on the points above. \n    * For candidates with potential:  Clearly state areas for growth using *your* expertise (e.g., \"While their bug reports were clear, we'd need to train them on XPath best practices, as you highlighted in the assignment expectations\").  This helps calibrate everyone's expectations. \n\n**By using this approach, we'll be able to effectively identify Junior SDETs who have the fundamental skills and, most importantly, the aptitude to learn and grow within your team.** \n\nPlease share the first candidate's submission whenever you're ready, and let's get this evaluation process going! \n",

        "OK. Now I will share the same for Senior SDET as well. But this is complex, since this will be a complete folder. SO I WANT YOU TO USE YOUR FULL POWER TO ANALYSE IT, SINCE IT IS A CRUCIAL ROLE AS WELL. BE ACCURATE. HERE IS THE CODE FOLDER:   This is the FEEDBACK FOR THIS CODE REPO:   1. Overall POM structure of the framework is not as per the standard.\nIt should be:\nsrc/main/java/pages - contains all your pages\nsrc/test/java/tests - contains all your tests.\nIssues:\nThere are multiple pom.xml files\nAll the three folders have separate src/main/java. this is not allowed\nOne testNG.xml is enough.\n2. One implicit wait is enough because If the element is located before the timeunits, the driver will proceed immediately to the next step without waiting for the full duration.\n3. We can make the scrollToElement method as one single method instead of two separate methods. Pass the string locator parameter along with the webelement and surround it with exception handling and webdriver wait instead of Thread.sleep.\n4. Include exception handling for all the methods especially the weblement parameters are involved.\n5. Remove unused imports\n6. Default sleep time(2 seconds) will not work in all the cases.\n7. Use descriptive variable names that clearly convey the purpose of the variable\n8. It is not recommended to use absolute xpath, although it does the work, it gets affected when DOM tree changes in the future.\n9. Absolute xpath was used across all pages. it is not advisable to use in POM framework because it is tightly coupled to the structure of HTML DOM. Also it is in contrast to the readability and maintainability\n10. Usage of sleep() function back to back makes the code look ugly and affects the performance of the test. Try to implement explicit wait.\n11. Webdriver wait is recommended with precise expected conditions\n12. Check end of statement.\n13. xpath could have been constructed better instead of hardcoded class name\n14. Avoid print statement anywhere inside the framework\n15. driver is not passed as object properly.\n16. static nested class logic is wrong because you're attempting to declare a static nested class (LoginPage) within another class (BasePage) without it being in top-level class.\n17. Test Data should not be inside function. It should obtained from separate test data class or properties file or JSON file.\n18. Usage of \"By\" without importing By package.\n19. Print is not allowed.\n20. Constructor is not called properly\n21. xpath is not constructed as per the standard\n22. this function is not returning the driver.\n23. Methodname is explicitly using reflection. It's generally preferable to explicitly specify method names.\n24. Exception handling should be in page level, not in test level. it works but it is not a best practice.\n25. Throwable exception is so broad. Should be Exception instead.\n26. It is recommended to use assertions directly in test methods without enclosing them in try-catch blocks.\n27. All these testdata should be in separate test data class file or .properties file or in excel file to have easy maintainability when you want to change anything in the future.\n28. Could have been configured in a single testNG file.  AGAIN MAKE SURE THIS IS JUST THE EXPECTED FEEDBACK, YOU NEED TO ANALYSE THE CANDIDATE'S OWN BUG REPORT AS WELL SINCE IT MIGHT VARY IN FORMAT BUT THE BUG IS SAME. SO MAKE THAT\n SURE ",

        "Let's do this!  Evaluating Senior SDETs is a serious endeavor, and I'll bring my A-game to this analysis. Your detailed \"expected feedback\" on the code repository is invaluable, but you're right – we absolutely cannot blindly apply it.  \n\nHere's the breakdown of my approach for senior candidates:\n\n**1. Big Picture First: Framework Design and Architecture**\n\n*  I'll look for evidence of the candidate's understanding of SOLID principles and good design patterns (Page Object Model, in this case).\n* **Key Points:**\n    * Directory Structure: You rightly point out issues in the folder organization. A Senior should demonstrate an understanding of standard Maven project layouts.\n    * POM Files: Multiple pom.xml files suggest a lack of understanding of module dependency management. I'll check how well they've modularized the project. \n    * TestNG Configuration: Redundant TestNG files raise concerns. I'll examine how effectively they manage test suites and configurations.\n* **Beyond the \"Expected\":** Even if the candidate hasn't articulated every flaw your feedback mentions, does their own analysis hint at an understanding of the importance of these higher-level concepts?\n\n**2. Core Selenium and Automation Practices** \n\n* Your feedback provides excellent points about implicit waits, scroll handling, exception management, sleeps, locators, etc. I'll be laser-focused on these in the candidate's work AND reporting:\n    * **Locators:**  Overuse of absolute XPaths is a HUGE red flag at a senior level. \n    * **Waits:** Blindly using `sleep()` is unacceptable.  I expect explicit waits tailored to expected conditions.\n    * **Exception Handling:** This MUST be well-structured. Broad exceptions, handling at the wrong levels, etc., are dealbreakers.\n* **What to look for even if not in *their* report:** Do any code examples *they provide* as fixes/suggestions demonstrate best practices, even if the initial repo did not? \n\n**3.  Coding Standards & Maintainability**\n\n* Your points about variable names, \"By\" import, static nested classes, and general code clarity are spot on for assessing a senior. This goes beyond mere functionality; it's about building a maintainable framework. \n* **Candidate's Mindset:** Even if their bug report isn't styled perfectly, does the language they use when describing the issues hint at a desire for code readability and long-term maintainability?\n\n**4. Test Data Handling and Test Design**\n\n* You correctly point out that test data should NOT be hardcoded in the tests.\n*  **Key areas:**\n     *  Externalization: I'll be examining if the candidate suggests using property files, Excel sheets, or (ideally) a data-driven testing approach.  \n     * Test Case Design: Do their suggestions indicate any understanding of boundary conditions, negative testing, or equivalence classes, even implicitly?\n\n**5. The \"Soft Skills\" - Communication, Collaboration, and Potential**\n\nFor a senior role, technical expertise is assumed. These factors are what differentiate a great Senior SDET from a merely good one:\n\n* **Structure and Clarity of Feedback:** Is the bug report well-organized, technically sound, and easy to follow? Does it clearly prioritize issues?  *A senior's communication should be excellent.* \n* **Actionable Insights:** Does the candidate provide clear, concrete suggestions for fixes or improvements, not just vague complaints? \n* **Thinking Beyond the Code:**  Do they demonstrate an understanding of the impact these flaws have on teamwork, CI/CD pipelines, or overall product quality? This shows a strategic perspective.\n\n**The Final Decision (and Setting Your Team Up for Success)**\n\n* \"Strong Yes\": Deep technical understanding AND evidence of good design sense, communication skills, and ability to lead and mentor more junior team members. \n* \"Yes (Potential)\": Solid technical base, maybe missing some nuanced senior-level design/architecture instincts, but shows clear willingness and ability to learn. This is where YOUR mentorship comes in - you're confirming this person can grow *with* your team.\n* \"No\": Significant technical gaps at this level, poor communication, or, critically, a lack of self-awareness about areas needing improvement (this shows poor potential).\n\n**Give me the candidate's submission -  let's put them to the test!  Remember, this process is not just about finding a code reviewer, but potentially a future leader for your QA team.** \n",
